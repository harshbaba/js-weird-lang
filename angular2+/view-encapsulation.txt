To Use Encapsulation in our component import it from angular core and define it inside @component decorator.
import { Component, OnInit, ViewEncapsulation} from '@angular/core';
@Component({
  selector: 'app-live-trains',
  templateUrl: './live-trains.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./live-trains.component.css'],
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None,
  providers: [LiveTrainService, GlobalHelper, LinkService]
})

# ViewEncapsulation.emulated
a.Angular will not create a Shadow DOM for the component.
b.Style will be scoped to the component.
c.This is the default value for encapsulation.

# ViewEncapsulation.None
a.There is no shadow DOM.
b.Style is not scoped to the component.

#ViewEncapsulation.Native
a.Angular will create a Shadow DOM for the component.
b.Style will be scoped to the component.
Note:This require Shadow Dom feature so if your browser does not support it then it will not work.
To solve this problem angular has create "emulated". Because "emulated" work as Natively (mostly same as Shadow Dom) but
not require Shadow Dom Browsers.
