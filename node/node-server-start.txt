1.Check node is installed or not
=>open terminal and paste node -v
	if it shows node version, it means node is installed.

2.How to start node server
=>Create a folder anywhere and put all projects inside this, like we place all projects
inside htdocs folder.
We are considering you have a folder "www" inside "D" drive 
and create your projects here like: helloworld, test1

=> for starting server
	=>open terminal
	=>go to D:\www 
	and run http-server -go

Now you can open your project in browser at http://10.0.2.2:8080/
like: http://10.0.2.2:8080/helloworld/
http://10.0.2.2:8080/myapp

3.CTRL+C to stop server.
