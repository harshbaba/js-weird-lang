3.Create a connection in robo mongo to click on create button
after this you have a connection like http://localhost:27017/
if all things have gone well then you will got msg:
"It looks like you are trying to access MongoDB over HTTP on the native driver port."

4.Now we will create a folder to store data.
We are creating inside "C:\Program Files\MongoDB"
=>data=>db
Note:you can create db folder anywhere, any drive.

=====My Recommendation===========
"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath "C:\data\db"
This will be run in every situtation like(in corporate or personal).

MongoDB requires a data directory to store all data. MongoDB’s default data directory path is \data\db. 
Create this folder using the following commands from a Command Prompt:

You can specify an alternate path for data files using the --dbpath option to mongod.exe, for example:
=>enter this command
	C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin\mongod.exe --dbpath C:\Program Files\MongoDB\data\db
	
	If your path includes spaces, enclose the entire path in double quotes, for example:
	"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\data\db"
	
	You may also specify the dbpath in a configuration file.
	
	To start MongoDB, run mongod.exe. For example, from the Command Prompt:
	C:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe
	
	To connect to MongoDB through the mongo.exe shell, open another Command Prompt.
	C:\mongodb\bin\mongo.exe
