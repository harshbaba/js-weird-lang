13.CallBack
A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing — hence the name ‘call back’.
In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this, functions can take functions as arguments, and can be returned by other functions. 
Functions that do this are called higher-order functions. Any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function.
