Introduction to Node.js**
    What is Node.js?
    
    *Why use Node.js/Advantaages?:
        Adavantages of Node over other server programming languages:
            ->Replaced multithreading by Asynchronous to remove the context switching overhead
            ->non blocking concurrent I/O operations, best for real time apps
        Concepts: Single threaded, Asynchronous, event-driven and non-blocking I/O
        Performative: 
            ->Handle concurrent operation 
        Scalable: 
            ->highly scalable, vertical(cluster by child process) and horizontal(clusters)
